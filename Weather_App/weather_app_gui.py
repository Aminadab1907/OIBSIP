"""
Project Name: Weather App with GUI
Project Objective: To create weather app with a simple GUI using the "tkinterbootstrap'
 library that fetches for the GUI design and display scurrent weather data for a
 user-specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API
Project Key Features: Fetching current weather data (temperature, humidity, weather description) for a specified city.

** We will make use of teh OpenWeatherMap API free plan to have
access to real-time weather data through HTTP Calls
