#1 BMI (Body Mass Index Calculator)

Project Description
------------------
The "main.py" calculates the body mass index of the user provided it has received user weight and height input data.

The program is modularised so that all inputs have their function, the BMI calculator has its function and also the classification of the user in the BMI chart based on the BMI calculator results has its function.
When the program is executed:
  1. The user is asked to enter their name
  2. The user is then asked to enter their weight in Kilograms
  3. The user is then asked to enter their height in meters
    N.B - The program is created in such a way that the user is asked to enter height and weight values within a reasonable range and that range is based on the world records of the highest and lowest data scored for both height and weight. Any data outside this range is deemed incorrect and the user is prompted to enter the correct data.
  4. The BMI calculator function calculates the BMI
  5. The result is then displayed along with the name in a capitalized form to add a personal and formal touch, the BMI value, and the category into which the user is placed based on their BMI.


*** This program is completely basic with no GUI and is entirely command-line based.

The "main_bmi_ui.py" is the GUI version of the main.py program described above.
The program is a modified version of main.py where a GUI feature is added to the program with the help of the tkinter and ttkbootstrap libraries
When the program is executed:
  1. A window is generated with input fields for the name, weight and height data of the person
  2. As long as the user provides a value of weight and height, when the user clicks the "Calculate BMI" button, a result is provided showing the BMI result and the corresponding category.
  3. If there is an error, generated by a user entering an unappropriate data, An error messagebox pops up alerting the user to enter the right data.
