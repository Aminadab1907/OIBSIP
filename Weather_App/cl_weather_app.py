"""
Project Name: Weather App
Project Objective: To create a command-line weather app that fetches and displays
current weather data for a user-specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API
Project Key Features: Fetching current weather data (temperature, humidity, weather description) for a specified city.

** We will make use of teh OpenWeatherMap API free plan to have
access to real-time weather data through HTTP Calls
